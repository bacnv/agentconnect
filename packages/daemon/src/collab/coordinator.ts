   *
   * AUTHORIZATION (origin-only, fail-closed, §5.3): the only session a caller may reply into
   * is the origin the CURRENT turn was woken from. The caller identity comes from the trusted
   * session context; `sessionId` is the sole tool input and is validated to equal the turn's

   * refused — an agent can never inject into an arbitrary session.
   */
  /**
   * The #800 inferred reply — the mechanism half the parked directive fix (#905) could not
   * substitute for, measured on the webchat night-collection cell: a COLD needsReply child
   * mostly answers its delegation as its ordinary assistant response (a correct answer,
   * delivered to nobody) and never reaches for any messaging tool. The pi-intercom pattern:
   * when a delegation turn ends cleanly without the child having sent its
   * `sendMessage {sessionId}` report, deliver the child's final ordinary output TO the parent
   * as the report, explicitly marked inferred — a headless child's answer is never silently
   * dropped.
   *
   * Exactly-one-obligation scoping (the niche boundary):
   *  - only turns whose OWN trusted CallMeta carries `needsReply` + an origin — i.e. the
   *    delegation wake itself (and a re-delegation into the same child). Human follow-ups,
   *    plain calls, continuations, and unrelated turns of the child session never infer;
   *  - only when the obligation is still open (`replyState === 'awaiting'`) — a report the
   *    child actually sent this turn, or one that terminally failed, is respected;
   *  - only clean completions: failed/suppressed turns keep their own semantics
   *    (`viewSessionStatus` reports those);
   *  - deferred when the session still has live background tasks — the bg-task wake exists
   *    precisely to let the child report AFTER its task settles, and that wake turn (which
   *    carries no CallMeta) will not re-infer; the obligation then resolves through the
   *    child's own report or stays visibly `awaiting`.
   *
   * A child whose final output is empty or the no-response sentinel produced NOTHING to
   * infer — the parent gets an explicit "finished without reporting" wake instead of
   * silence. Delivery reuses `replyToSession` verbatim (origin authorization, hop charge,
   * queue/coalesce semantics, `markChildParentReply`), so an inferred report is
   * indistinguishable from a real one on every axis EXCEPT the marker the parent (and the
   * artifacts) see. Runs while the turn's activeTurnCallMeta is still installed.
