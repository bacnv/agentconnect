/**
 * The **outbound thread-key strategy** (`threadKeyForPost` in §7.4, stage S2) —
 * the outbound mirror of inbound thread canonicalization, and the ONE place that
 * conversion lives.
 *
 * A post whose key does not match what the next inbound reply resolves to opens
 * a session that reply can never reach, so this has to follow each platform's
 * own conversation model:
 *
 *  - Slack, and Feishu group chats, thread off a message: the post's own ts IS
 *    the segment.
 *  - Telegram groups have no native threads, so a reply resolves to
 *    `tg:<root message id>`. The `tg:` prefix also keeps reply roots out of the
 *    numeric forum-TOPIC namespace. (A root post into a forum lands in General,
 *    whose messages carry no `is_topic_message`, so replies there resolve
 *    through the same `tg:` ladder rather than to a topic id.)
 *  - A Discord guild root post keys on its own message id. If a native thread is
 *    opened from that post, Discord gives the thread channel the same id, so the
 *    first in-thread reply reaches the initialized session. Discord DMs remain
 *    one continuous conversation keyed by their channel id.
 *  - A DM is one continuous conversation, keyed `dm` on Telegram and by the
 *    chat on Feishu. A post into one joins it; it never starts a second.
 *
 * Whether the target is a DM is not derivable from the id, so callers pass what
 * the platform reports (`isIm` from `getChannelInfo`), defaulting to a non-DM
 * conversation.
 *
 * The DEFAULT arm — the post's own ts — is Slack's rule and the core one:
 * webchat/hook/dream anchors and any unknown platform key exactly as before
 * this seam, when the function was three platform literals in
 * `messages/normalized.ts`. Each arm must agree with its platform's inbound
 * canonicalization (`platforms/<id>/threading.ts`), which is why they are
 * registered per platform rather than inferred.

 *
 * Slack alone is registered: its `thread_ts` is both the post anchor and the session

 * addresses a thread as its own CHANNEL, Telegram groups thread by reply into the `tg:`
 * namespace, and Feishu's topic root is the form `shareFile` already refuses rather than
 * repurposes — each needs its own anchor mapping through the gateway before it can be
