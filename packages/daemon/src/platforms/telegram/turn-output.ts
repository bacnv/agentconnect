/**
 * Telegram's **turn-output surface** (integration-plugin-architecture.md §7.3,
 * stage S2) — the first platform body to move out of `daemon.ts` against the
 * seam published there.
 *
 * What it proves: the seam supports an applier living outside core. This one
 * needs exactly two host capabilities — recording a reply segment and appending
 * a transcript row — and a structural view of the turn. Everything else it
 * touches is Telegram's own (`TelegramConnection`, the reply anchor, the
 * message-edit ceiling), which is what "platform-shaped" means in §7.3.
 *
 * The turn is taken STRUCTURALLY, not as the core `Pending` type: a platform
 * borrows the fields it renders with and cannot reach the rest of core's turn
 * machinery. That is the boundary — if a future action needs more, the addition
 * is visible here rather than smuggled in through a wide type.
