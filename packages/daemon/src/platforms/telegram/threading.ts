 *   - native reply-root → `tg:<root>` from Telegram's own `message_thread_id` in a
 *                          plain supergroup (Telegram auto-threads replies to the root)
 *   - DM                → one continuous session per chat (`dm`)
 *   - reply that maps   → the session the replied-to message belongs to, resolved from
 *                          the transcript (basic groups carry no `message_thread_id`)
 *   - otherwise         → a fresh session rooted at this message (`tg:<msgId>`) — a new
 *                          @mention, or a reply we can't place
 * A fresh @mention (message N, no thread root) keys `tg:N`; every later reply in that
 * thread carries `message_thread_id = N`, so it keys `tg:N` too — the two meet with no
 * lookup. The non-topic keys are deliberately NON-numeric so posting never mistakes
 * them for a forum `message_thread_id` (see TelegramConnection.postMessage). No-op for
 * other platforms or when the thread is already set.
 *
 * A reply ALSO resolves its author onto `msg.replyToAuthor`, which costs one transcript
 * lookup in a forum topic where it previously cost none.
